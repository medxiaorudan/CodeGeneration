# Key Impacts on Code Generation:

## Prompts Design Enhancement:
- The incorporation of phrases like "You are a powerful XXX model. You can do XX." during the training of large language models plays a pivotal role in guiding the model towards better understanding and execution of tasks. These phrases serve as contextual cues, aiding the model in comprehending user requests and generating more accurate responses. This approach not only molds the model's behavior to align with user expectations but also enhances its controllability and usability, making it well-suited for specific tasks or application scenarios.

In contrast, without such guidance, the model may generate more random text outputs, lacking explicit instructions. This can lead to outputs that lack consistency and fail to meet user expectations. Including these descriptive phrases improves the overall effectiveness of the model.

- For optimal prompt design, utilizing an instructed prompt format with explicit markers like [INST] [/INST] proves superior to one-sentence prompts. This format ensures clear instruction delineation, resulting in the generation of more precise and targeted code.

## Model Comparison Insights:
- Opting for a larger model size, such as CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, offers distinct advantages over smaller variants like CodeLlama-13b/7b-Instruct.

- Larger GPT models exhibit superior performance compared to the Open-source CodeLlama model. However, after fine-tuning, the smallest size model of CodeLlama, CodeLlama-7b-finetuned can demonstrate nearly identical performance levels as GPT.

## Efficiency of Prompting Tools:
- Tools such as Langchain play a significant role in streamlining the prompting process, thereby elevating the efficiency of interactions with the model.

- Langchain and similar tools contribute to a smoother and more user-friendly experience when engaging with language models, enhancing overall usability and effectiveness.

# Limitation: Code Variability Concerns 
- Notably, the generated code displays significant variability, lacking the uniformity essential for effective unit testing. This introduces challenges in establishing consistent and reliable testing procedures.

- Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring robust testing processes and maintaining high-quality code. Considering standardized coding practices may offer a valuable solution to mitigate code variability and enhance the reliability of testing procedures.
